## 📘 Description

The Condensed Transformational Representation (RTC) is a theoretical and algorithmic framework for **data representation, compression, and symbolic encoding**, based on the application of transformations to a **shared base state**.

RTC offers a differential and symbolic model in which data is not stored directly, but through the transformations required to reconstruct it from a common starting point. This approach enables efficient compression, gliphic encoding, and intentional obfuscation properties.

## 🧠 Core Concepts

- **Universal transformability:** Any data can be reconstructed from a base state through a sequence of transformations.
- **Transformational glyphs:** Each transformation τᵢ is represented as a **functional glyph**, whose interpretation depends on shared rules and context.
- **Glyphic compactness:** Rather than storing raw data, the system stores its **condensed transformation history**.
- **Reversible ambiguity:** Without τ, the base state may correspond to multiple plausible reconstructions.
- **Structural encoding:** Data is represented not just by content, but by its **transformational form**.

## 🧪 Experimental Validation

RTC was evaluated against traditional compressors such as Gzip using both structured and random datasets.

| Metric                                | RTC (structured)    | Gzip     |
|--------------------------------------|----------------------|----------|
| **IR (Information Return)**          | 246.58               | —        |
| **TCC (Transformational Computational Cost)** | 0.0039 s              | —        |
| **Final Encoded Size** (bytes)       | 24                   | 34       |

> Note: Results come from a simple Python-based implementation. Compression is particularly effective on structurally redundant datasets.

## 🔒 Additional Properties

- **Semantic obfuscation:** Transformations can act as symbolic keys, enabling structural steganography.
- **Glyphic encoding:** A visual system is proposed where glyphs operate as compound transformational operators, interpretable in context.
- **Transformational modularity:** The system supports composition, reversibility, and conditional variants.
